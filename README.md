# Disclaimer

Following dotfiles are tailored to macOS; they weren't tested on other platforms, use at your own risk.

# How to Install

Run following command:
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nugmanoff/dotfiles/master/init.sh)"
```

These are my dotfiles and not everything may be suitable to your liking, so be careful if you plan on running the command above.

Keep in mind that my dotfiles include usage of `yabai` which requires to have SIP disabled to be fully functional. Be really careful with this one. You can read more on [yabai's wiki](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/wiki/Disabling-System-Integrity-Protection)

# If you want to use simpler version

This one will not contain yabai and skhd and all of the related WM hustle.

# Credits

Credits goes to my bro [Poorya](https://github.com/pooryasheikh/) for discovering these amazing dotfiles by [ZhongXiLu](https://github.com/ZhongXiLu/dotfiles) and telling me about them. Those dotfiles served as an amazing base scaffold for me. Thanks to ZhongXiLu I discovered [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/) subreddit and got to know the [rice](https://github.com/ZhongXiLu/dotfiles#what-does-rice-mean) term.
