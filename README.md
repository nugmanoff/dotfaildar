# Credits

Credits goes to my bro [Poorya](https://github.com/pooryasheikh/) for discovering these amazing dotfiles by [ZhongXiLu](https://github.com/ZhongXiLu/dotfiles) and telling me about them. Those dotfiles served as an amazing base scaffold for me. Thanks to ZhongXiLu I discovered [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/) subreddit and got to know the [rice](https://github.com/ZhongXiLu/dotfiles#what-does-rice-mean) term.
